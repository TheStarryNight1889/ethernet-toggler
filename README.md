# ethernet-toggler
so basically if you have ethernet plugged into your windows pc but want to connect to wifi instead, you have to either unplug the cable or go digging through adapter settings in windows and disable the ethernet adapter. 
this program solves that by adding toggling functionality in the taskbar.

i hope it helps someone.

to use it just update the interface name as show in windows control pannel

i recomend adding a .bat file to your start up folder which will execute the script on login.
i have included one as an example
